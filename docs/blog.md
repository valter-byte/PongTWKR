So. Hello! First entry here. I've just completed v0.3 "Foolproof". Decided it was a good way to limit the options, and added info.

When I coded this, I was half awake half asleep, so the first version had atrocious ortographic mistakes. Before doing this, I was feeling a bit dizzy, but I wen to sleep and I've got better. 

This update was needed, because, if I keep going with this in the future, a tweaker that lets you break your entire system, is, well... a not-so-useful-tweaker... anyways. Today I added /PongTWKR/docs. And did v0.2 and v0.3. 


Tomorrow, or in a couple of hours if I'm still awake, I'll upload v0.4. 

If anyone reads this, lol, I guess you found a simple tweaker too early... see ya.
