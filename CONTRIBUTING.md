# Contributing

PongTWKR main and (future) CLI branch aim to be Open Source, open to be contributed freely. At least now, feel free to get the source code and tweak it to your liking. ;)
When we finally divide the project (/main & /cli), /main will remain to more stable and UI addons/contributions, while CLI will be the playground for everybody.
