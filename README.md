# PongTWKR
An easy-to-use, handful tool for tweaking CPU, RAM, and other PC components like Swappiness, governor, etc. easily, without having to confront the terminal or shady directories. Please note that this program is targeted for those that can't/don't want to mess with commands or files on their Linux Distro, but want to get overall better performance.

# How to use

Well. I've just uploaded v0.1. Until 1.0, PongTWKR will only work by simplifying tweaking commands on the terminal. Firstly, install the source code "pongtwkr.py" and move it to a PATH directorie (for example, /usr/local/bin) with sudo mv or with your file manager using super user perms. As for v0.1, I've only added Swappiness, Governor and Info;
sudo pongtwkr swappiness <value>
sudo pongtwkr governor <value> [performance, for example]
sudo pongtwkr info

Please note that PongTWKR needs psutil to work correctly.

# If you want to help:

Just tell me whatever other tweaking option should I add. That will completely help my no-creativity brain. Or send me screenshots of the bugs/errors.

# v0.2 tomorrow, probably adding sillier things. Bai-bai!
